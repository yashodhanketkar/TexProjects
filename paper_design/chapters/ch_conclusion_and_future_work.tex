\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion_and_futur_work}

The system performed satisfactorily during the tests. The application was able to select the model for the provided dataset. The best-suited model showed great accuracy during the prediction process. The whole process required minimum human interaction.

Future work focuses on the implementation of unsupervised learning algorithms. With this, the system will be able to use unlabeled datasets for training. Implementation of continuous learning will be another focus. This will massively increase the adaptability and efficiency of the system.
