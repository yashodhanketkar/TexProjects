\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion_and_futur_work}

The system performed satisfactorily during the tests. The application was able to select the model for the provided dataset. The best-suited model was able to meet the user requirements. The whole process required minimum human interaction.

Future work focuses on the testing system with different datasets and other supervised learning algorithms. With this, we will be able to estimate the performance and reduce uncertainties in the system.
