\section{Conclusion and Future work} \label{sec:conclusion_and_future_work}
In this paper, we present a novel system. The system provides the end user the ability to train the best-suited model for the problem. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, this system can be employed by healthcare professionals for the detection of anomalies such as arrhythmia in patients. The system is tested with the ECG MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. {\responsemod The models trained and selected by the system showed good classification performance. These models also performed satisfactorily against training datasets of other models, suggesting good general classification performance.}

Future work will involve the use of other freely available datasets to test the general classification performance of the system as well as testing the current system in a real-time environment. {\responsemod Future work will also focus on modifying the system to work with non-labeled databases by employing unsupervised learning methods.}
