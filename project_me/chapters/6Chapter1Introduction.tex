\section*{\centering Introduction}

In the past few years, COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) has rapidly become a pandemic. This disease, caused by a strain of the Corona virus, was discovered near the end of 2019, hence it was named COVID-19 disease. This disease primarily attacks the human respiratory system. The infected respiratory system leads to various complicated respiratory problems such as lung damage, pnuemonia, etc. The first reported case of COVID-19 was discovered in Wuhan, China. The disease spread in Wuhan rapidly, and after that, the disease began to spread world wide at an alarming rate. The World Health Organization soon classified the disease as a pandemic.

The infection of COVID-19 in patients showed extreme variation in severity. In some cases, the patients showed extremely mild symptoms, while in other cases, they developed extremely severe infections. The infection severity was heavily impacted by the comorbidities of patients. Patients with comorbidities result in server infections as well as lead to fatal cases. Paitents with prior comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory problems showed higher severity.

Cardiovascular comorbidities include various circulation disorders such as arrhythmia, artery diseases, hypertension, and heart diseases. Arrhythmia itself is a disorder, but it also serves as a symptom in other disorders. An arrhythmia is an irregular beating of the heart. This leads to either a faster heartbeat (tachycardia), a slower heartbeat (bradycardia), or a random beating pattern. Detection of arrhythmia suggest the possibility of other cardiovascular disorders, hence it is primary test in patients admitted due to COVID-19 infections.

The electrocardiogram signals, or ECG signals for short, are used to prepare charts. These charts are used to detect arrhythmia in patients. These ECG charts are recordings of human heartbeats. The ECG is generally taken with an 8-lead or 12-lead system. \Cref{fig:normal_abnormal_ecg_signal} shows the normal and abnormal ECG singals recorded on 12-leads. The heart rhythm is captured at a 120 Hz frequency. The chart is observed by a primary care physician. If the chart shows abnormalities, the patient is said to have arrhythmia. The patients with arrhythmias are further tested for other cardiovascular diseases or disorders.

The detection of arrhythmia from the ECG record is a slow and repetitive process. This process can be shortened by using a machine learning system. Use of machine learning systems will shorten the time required for detection of arrhythmia. This will also reduce the stress from the medical supervisors and staff. As medical facilities have a large number of ECG records, machine learning system will be able to produce extremely accurate results. The use of machine learning will reduce human errors. This will allow the medical professional to focus on more complex problems and better patient care.

In this project, we are using a machine learning system to detect the arrhythmia in COVID-19 patients. The system takes the ECG records from the patients and generates a few models. These models are evaluated and compared against each other. The system employs a weightage-based selection system to select the most-suited model for the task.

\section{Machine Learning}\label{sec:machine_learning_intro_chapter}

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Machine learning is a process in which a computer learns from experience. The machine learning system is used to obtain meaning from the available data. Machine learning uses statistical models and advanced mathematics to find patterns and meaning from provided data. Machine learning does not depend on explicit programming but on learning algorithms derived from various statistical models. The objective of machine learning is to obtain meaningful experience and use this experience to solve complex classification and regression problems. The large amount of data and observations needed to generate a high performance machine learning model Another objective of machine learning is to allow the computer to learn from experience with minimum human interaction.

Machine learning takes the data from the users and converts it into structured or unstructured forms. While most algorithms and models prefer structured data, machine learning can utilize both structured and unstructured data according to its needs. For example, machine learning can forecast the amount of solar radiation from various natural elements. The machine learning system was used in the dissertation to detect the arrhythmia from ECG signals. The system is provided with a template of the five machine learning models, ECG records of the patients, and user preference parameters. The user parameters are used to generate the weightage. The data is split into 80:20 ratios. The system generates the five models using templates and 80\% of the data. These five models are evaluated with weightage and the remaining 20\% of the data.

Machine learning systems are generally classified into three types: supervised learning systems, unsupervised learning systems, and reinforcement learning systems. The supervised learning system utilizes well-labeled data for learning operations. The supervised learning system is often preferred in a known environment. The supervised learning system performs better than the unsupervised learning system in classification tasks. The unsupervised learning system is trained with unlabeled datasets. Unsupervised learning systems are used in clustering and regression problems. The reinforcement learning system is a learning system based on decisions. In this system, previous learning experiences influence the future learning and learning rate. This feedback loop allows the machine to validate its experience, leading to a self learning system. This system can work with or without labeled data, and it needs minimal human interaction for training purposes.

Machine learning is used in image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, prediction systems, chatbots, classification and detection systems. The use of machine learning is already prominent in the healthcare industry, smart cities, IT industries, R\&D industries, etc.

\section{Problem Statement} \label{sec:problem_statement}
In current COVID-19 pandemic life threatening complications can be avoided with earlier diagnosis. One of such complications is arrhythmia which can be detected by reading ECG signals. This task is carried out by medical personnel. This repetitive and mundane task puts strain on medical staff.

Supervised learning models can be used for such tasks. These models have their own set advantages and disadvantages. Hence automating selection of the best model for required tasks will allow medical personnel to customise applications based on need. This will reduce strain from medical staff and allow them to focus on patient care.

\section{Motivation} \label{sec:motivation}

COVID-19 disease became a global pandemic in 2019. Since then, it has caused around 580 million infections world-wide and 6.42 million deaths, while in India it caused a total of 44.5 million infections, resulting in the deaths of half a million citizens. The infection severity varied from individual to individual, but it has been observed that patients with comorbidities were more likely to result in severe infections. The most common comorbidities observed in these patients were prior respiratory damage caused by other diseases or disorders. The second most common comorbidity was cardiovascular complications.

The cardiovascular comborbidities cause a large number of severe cases and fatalities in COVID-19 patients. The main contributing factor to this was the silent nature of these cardiovascular disorders. Most cardiovascular disorders are hard to detect and left untreated in a large number of cases. Earlier diagnosis of cardiovascular disease will lead to better treatment of patients. This will reduce the number of undetected cases. Cardiovascular diseases are often diagnosed by analyzing ECG records of patients for the presence of arrhythmia. This process is extremely time consuming. Automating this process will reduce the strain placed on medical staff significantly. This will allow them to tackle more complex and important problems. The early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease will allow the proper treatment and patient care for the patient.

During research, we noticed that there was a lack of literature for model selection systems based on user requirements. Therefore, another motivation behind the project is the development of an automated system for the selection of a model. In this system, models are selected from the weightage generated from user choices and performance evaluation of the models. The goal behind the weightage based system is to allow users to give input to the system based on the most important factors. This can be higher accuracy at the cost of prediction time, or lower accuracy at the cost of prediction time. This way, the users are given choice in the selection of the model that will meet their own requirements.

\section{Beneficiaries} \label{sec:beneficiaries}

This system is helpful for medical personnels handling covid-19 cases. This system will also help other patients that suffer from cardiovascular problems or other problems.

The system can be used for a wide range of applications, such as detection of epilepsy from frequency charts obtained during testing, also detection of other disorders. This system will reduce workload from medical staff and allow for better understanding of problems present in patients' cases.

This system can be trained once for generalized predictions, or used for unique purposes depending on users needs. The system does not need machine learning experts to operate, it can be trained and used by end users directly, hence providing an additional layer of security.

\section{Scope of the project} \label{sec:scope_of_the_project}

To make the system more efficient, data used for training is provided in csv format. And obtained results are stored in json format. The system handles imputed data with the help of the pandas library. The dataset provided needs to be specific format regardless of length and parameters present in the dataset. The datasets used in this projects are available on kaggle and are converted in required format, but if needed the raw datasets obtained directly from machines can be used for operational purposes.
